We showed that the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) can be adapted towards the semantic segmentation task. Its performance is similar to that of an U-Net. However, it is more computationally expensive. Therefore, in its current form does not provide any benefits over the simpler U-Net and FPN networks. Moreover, in the case of mobile robotics specifically, it has a major downside. Namely, the slower inference speed.

Furthermore, it can be concluded that pretraining on the VAE task does not have a significant positive, or negative effect on the final performance of the model. 

Finally, pre-training on the VAE task does not impact the quality of the model when there is only a limited amount of labelled data available. Moreover, using pre-trained weights from a classification task proves to be of vital importance to achieve good results, surpassing the importance of selecting the optimal architecture.
