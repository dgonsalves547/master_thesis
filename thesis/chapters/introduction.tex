\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

This is the \LaTeX\ template for writing a TU/e Master of Science thesis. This version is from December 2021. Although this version is created by Marko Boon, the template is based on the version by Buijs~\cite{MScBuijs2010} and Nugteren~\cite{MScNugteren2010}.

One of the best resources for \LaTeX basics, and advanced constructs, is the \LaTeX wikibook\footnote{To be found at~\url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/}}. 

\section{Installation Instructions}

\subsection{TU/e MiKTeX installation}

This package is part of the TU/e MiK\TeX\ installation (since January 2022) and will be installed automatically if you install this TU/e MiK\TeX\ installation. The style files are located in the folder called \verb|tex/latex/tuemscthesis2021| and the sample files can be found in the folder called \verb|examples/tuemscthesis2021|. These folders are located in the local \TeX mf tree, which is usually located in \verb|C:\ProgramData\MiKTeX|.

\section{Manual installation}

If you don't have the TU/e MiK\TeX\ installation, please download \verb|tuemscthesis2021.zip| from the TU/e intranet page, where the corporate identity files are stored. Unzip the contents of this zip file to the folder where you want to write your thesis. Optionally, rename the file \verb|samplemscthesis.tex| and compile the file to test the installation. Note that you will need the \verb|notosans| fonts which are free and part of the \verb|noto| package. They should be automatically downloaded and installed if you compile the document for the first time. If everything compiles correctly, you can delete the sample files in the chapters and appendices subfolders and start writing your own document.

Good luck writing your thesis!
