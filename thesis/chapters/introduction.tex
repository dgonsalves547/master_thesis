This is the \LaTeX\ template for writing a TU/e Master of Science thesis. This version is from December 2021. Although this version is created by Marko Boon, the template is based on the version by Buijs~\cite{MScBuijs2010} and Nugteren~\cite{MScNugteren2010}.

One of the best resources for \LaTeX basics, and advanced constructs, is the \LaTeX wikibook\footnote{To be found at~\url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/}}.
