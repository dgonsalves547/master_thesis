\chapter*{Preface}\label{chapter:preface}

This thesis was conducted as part of the requirements for obtaining my Masterâ€™s degree. It represents the culmination of my academic journey, combining both the theoretical knowledge I have acquired over the years from the professors who taught me as well as the practical experience I gained from my time at the student team E.S.A.I.V Serpentine, my professional engagement at HWKY, and my research at Avular.

The latter provided me with the guidance and support during this thesis. I had many fruitful discussions with Bart Keulen, who also was a good mental support for when the results were not as good as we had hoped.

I want to thank Jakub Tomczak for his immense knowledge in the subject, which he graciously shared. As well as the help he provided in solving technical problems I came across. I also want to thank the Technical University Eindhoven for providing the computational resources required to run all experiments.

My peers from the study association also deserve special mention. The countless discussions we had and the thorough reviews they provided helped improve the readability of my thesis and ensured that errors were caught early. Their contributions made a significant difference, and for that, I am truly grateful.

I would also like to thank my roommates, who took over the cooking duties, allowing me to focus fully on my research. Their support and understanding made this journey smoother and more manageable.

Lastly, I extend my profound gratitude to my parents. Their steadfast support, encouragement, and unwavering belief in my abilities throughout my life have been instrumental to my success. This achievement would not have been possible without their enduring support.

As I present this thesis, I do so with a deep sense of accomplishment and gratitude to all those who have supported me along the way.
