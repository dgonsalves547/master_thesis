  abstract   = {A key need in different disciplines is to perform analytics over fast-paced data streams, similar in nature to the traditional OLAP analytics in relational databases - i.e., with filters and aggregates. Storing unbounded streams, however, is not a realistic, or desired approach due to the high storage requirements, and the delays introduced when storing massive data. Accordingly, many synopses/sketches have been proposed that can summarize the stream in small memory (usually sufficiently small to be stored in RAM), such that aggregate queries can be efficiently approximated, without storing the full stream. However, past synopses predominantly focus on summarizing single-attribute streams, and cannot handle filters and constraints on arbitrary subsets of multiple attributes efficiently. In this work, we propose OmniSketch, the first sketch that scales to fast-paced and complex data streams (with many attributes), and supports count aggregates with filters on multiple attributes, dynamically chosen at query time. The sketch offers probabilistic guarantees, a favorable space-accuracy tradeoff, and a worst-case logarithmic complexity for updating and for query execution. We demonstrate experimentally with both real and synthetic data that the sketch outperforms the state-of-the-art, and that it can approximate complex ad-hoc queries within the configured accuracy guarantees, with small memory requirements.},

  abstract = {The paper systematically studies the impact of a range of recent advances in convolution neural network (CNN) architectures and learning methods on the object categorization (ILSVRC) problem. The evaluation tests the influence of the following choices of the architecture: non-linearity (ReLU, ELU, maxout, compatability with batch normalization), pooling variants (stochastic, max, average, mixed), network width, classifier design (convolutional, fully-connected, SPP), image pre-processing, and of learning parameters: learning rate, batch size, cleanliness of the data, etc. The performance gains of the proposed modifications are first tested individually and then in combination. The sum of individual gains is greater than the observed improvement when all modifications are introduced, but the “deficit” is small suggesting independence of their benefits. We show that the use of 128 × 128 pixel images is sufficient to make qualitative conclusions about optimal network structure that hold for the full size Caffe and VGG nets. The results are obtained an order of magnitude faster than with the standard 224 pixel images.}

  abstract  = {This paper reviews and describes the state-of-the-art in localization of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs). The localization problem, the ability to accurately sense and estimate the location of a platform, lies at the heart of almost all AGV applications. Solving the localization problem is an essential precursor to more complex AGV tasks such as planing and task execution.},

  abstract   = {Generative adversarial networks are a kind of artificial intelligence algorithm designed to solve the generative modeling problem. The goal of a generative model is to study a collection of training examples and learn the probability distribution that generated them. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are then able to generate more examples from the estimated probability distribution. Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.},
