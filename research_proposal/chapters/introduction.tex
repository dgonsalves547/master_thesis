\section{Overall aim and goals}\label{sec:goals}
The main goal of this thesis will be the implementation of a (generative) Object Detection model that is able to provide reliable uncertainty estimates on its own predictions. Secondary to that,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a generative model to model the uncertainty of various scenes
          \subitem i.e. Detecting weird combinations of objects within a scene
    \item Use uncertainty to make more efficient use of human labelers.
    \item Design a system which can make efficient use of uncertainty of previous stages.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Possible RQs}
Current Ideas for possible RQs. (For the seminar we need to have (at least) 5 RQs, they do not need to all be answered)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can generative models be used for uncertainty prediction in Object Detection?
    \item Does increasing the iterations of a generative model decrease the uncertainty?
    \item Is uncertainty a good indicator for active learning?
    \item Is uncertainty a good indicator for relabeling?
    \item Can temporal data be used to improve Uncertainty Quantification?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation and Challenges}

Artificial Intelligence solutions are increasingly put in new and challenging scenarios. They are known to work well when the training and inference set are from the same distribution \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. However, it has been shown that models will predict with high scores for inputs that are not relevant \cite{Nguyen_2015_CVPR,szegedy2013intriguing}. It has also been shown that this can be used to attack these networks\cite{goodfellow2014explaining,dong2018boosting}.
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) can enable a system to detect when a prediction might be of lesser quality \cite{dÃ¤ubener2020detecting}, and allow it to preemptively react to that\cite{osti_1481629}. Either by stopping or requesting human intervention.
Furthermore, understanding when models are uncertain, allows for more effective data sampling and labeling by making use of active learning schemes \cite{settles2009active,Bernhardt_2022,yang2009effective}. The latter is especially useful in industries where labeling is expensive or time-consuming.

Object Detection is an especially difficult field as the model has many outputs of different types. It requires both regression (for localization) and classification \cite{Gasperini_2022}. Moreover, there are multiple uncertainties present:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objectness: \t Is a bounding box an object (of interests)?
    \item Classification: \t Is a bounding box of a certain class?
    \item Size: \t Is the size of the bounding box correct?
    \item Location: \t Is the location of the bounding box correct?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Broad Literature Analysis}\label{sec:broadliterature}

This project covers broader research areas, each will be covered separately in subsections \ref{sec:broadliterature:uncertainty} and \ref{sec:broadliterature:object_detection}. Related work in the combination will be described in subsection \ref{sec:broadliterature:combination}

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Quantification}\label{sec:broadliterature:uncertainty}
The ability to distinguish certain and uncertain outputs from machine learning models is useful for various reasons. It can be used for active learning \cite{yang2009effective,settles2009active,houlsby2011bayesian,Bernhardt_2022}, which makes better use of limited labeling capacity.

\citep{gal2016uncertainty} distinguishes two kinds of uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty, the uncertainty that is caused by imprecise input data, and epistemic uncertainty, the uncertainty that is caused by the model. Aleatoric uncertainty is often caused by imprecise measurements and can be reduced by improving the quality of our dataset and inputs. The latter, epistemic uncertainty, can be reduced by improving either the training procedure, increasing the amount of data or improving the model architecture.

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is an important factor to increase the trust in automated processes based on machine learning. Current methods often sample from existing networks \cite{gal2016dropout,NEURIPS2019_118921ef,miller2019evaluating} or predict parameters of a distribution \cite{choi2019gaussian,swiatkowski2020ktied}.


\subsubsection{Object Detection}\label{sec:broadliterature:object_detection}

\todo{Expand difference between one-stage and multi-stage}
There are two main paradigms within Object Detection, One-Stage \cite{zhou2019objects, bochkovskiy2020yolov4, wang2022yolov7} and Multi-Stage detectors \cite{girshick2014rich, girshick2015fast}. Single stage detectors directly detect a set of bounding boxes and their respective classes, whereas Multi-Stage detectors often first identify interesting patches which are then classified.

\todo{Describe the multi-faceted problem (i.e. both classification and regression)}

\todo{Distinction between backbone and head, and some examples}



\todo{Talk about "bag of freebies", these allow for better accuracy for the same inference speed at the cost of training time}


\subsubsection{In combination}\label{sec:broadliterature:combination}
The combination of Uncertainty Quantification and Object Detection is especially difficult as Object Detection is both a regression and a classification task.

\subsection{Formulation of the problem and objectives}
Let $x \in \mathbb{R}^{HxWxC}$ be the input image which contains objects $O_i$, which are a combination of a bounding box coordinates: $B_i = (x_{center}, y_{center}, x_{width}, y_{height})$ and a class $c \in C$. Our goal is to create a probabilistic model which

% Include a description of the overall aim and key objectives. Explain your research questions as well as possible. Identify potential general tasks that will need to be tackled in order to complete the project successfully.

% As a general rule-of-thumb, a potential evaluator would be asked to summarise the strong and weak points of the proposal as a whole. They will consider the strengths and weaknesses in such a way that they are comprehensible and substantiated for a broader scientific group. They will assess the quality, innovative character and academic impact of the proposal, including the challenging content, originality of the topic, scientific elements, potential to make an important contribution, effectiveness of proposed methodology, importance of the proposed research topic, etc.
