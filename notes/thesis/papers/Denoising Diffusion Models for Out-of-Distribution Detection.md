# Main Idea
Detect OOD samples by reconstructing multiple increasingly noised samples, and comparing them to the original.

# Summary

## DDPM

Samples $x_t$ are generated by $q(x_t|x_0)$ same as in [[Diffusion Models]]
A reconstruction is made: $x_{0,t} = q(x_0|x_t)$.
Then the (perceptual) similarity is measured between $S(x_{0,t}, x_t)$ as well  as the $MSE(x_{0,t}, x_t)$.
This is repeated for a $N$ different values for $t$.
These scores are then used to produce an OOD score.
A validation set can be used to determine a good cutoff for OOD score, to differentiate between in-distribution and OOD.

## Results

DDPM is compared with the following baselines:
* Generative
	- Likelihood
	- WAIC
	- Typicality
	- [[Density-of-States Estimation]]
- Reconstruction
	- AutoEncoder
	- AutoEncoder Mahlabonis
	- MemAE
	- AnoDDPM-Mod
	- DDPM (This paper)
